# Demographs from FIJI linescans
A collaborator recently asked me for assitance on generating demographs from fluorescent images of bacteria. Here, I detail a basic pipeline for how to generate linescans manually in FIJI then to apply a basic python script, written in Jupyter Notebook, to make a demograph. For these demographs, they are normalized by z-score to emphasize where signal is enriched along the cell body.

The code is well-annotated as to its function and application, and I have a PDF protocol for how to measure the linescans. Please refer to both of these.
